Now:
  ☐ input autocomplete plugin (like typeahead.js)
  ☐ add pure css tooltips like materializecss'
  ☐ add a storable form
  ☐ On mobile remove focus from liker after click (it should show the updated counter, not the text for removing the like...) (search for: "sticky hover")
  ☐ Test pointer with touchpad connected to a phone (working as a mouse), or on touchscreen laptop, or OTG a mouse to it
  ☐ add style on :focus, also add better keyboard navigation support

Next:
  ☐ center sortable names, or when also `text-align: center` they will look misaligned
  ☐ dinamically check for classes, like when using `isOpen` etc.
  ☐ reorganize widget_helper (like progressbar or noty), it currently conflicts with table_helper which is an entirely different thing
  ☐ find a pattern like ___ but for UNinitialize, use in combination with initializers (maybe when call it passe true or false)

Future:
  ☐ use emojione v3
  ☐ [widget] add better support for updating after options are set at runtime
  ☐ adding `@require`s to extenders (.before, .after) doesn't work, since they get moved after... maybe we should move left or right the one more to the left in the dependencies list instead...
  ☐ an utility for dinamically creating a dialog, like a modal for confirmation and stuff
  ☐ [SASS] add string related functions to _, take them from here: https://github.com/HugoGiraudel/SassyStrings/tree/master/stylesheets
  ☐ [demo] add init/destroy api to for Openers, Closers, and Togglers
  ☐ add this._onFocus ()
  ☐ selecter, like numbox but with custom values and chevrons, not editable (once it's done add it for editing the colors of the widgets)
  ☐ new checkable widget, like selectable but with checkboxes (should work like gmail's)
  ☐ maybe add also a special `scroll` option key, for triggering actions automagically
  ☐ add generalized affix/sticky support
  ☐ add i18n support
  ☐ add a `KineticDrag` component, or maybe a `kinetic` option to `draggable`

Maybe:
  ☐ add a .multiple.reverse
  ☐ sort sass files properties
  ☐ abort zoomable preloading on subsequent taps

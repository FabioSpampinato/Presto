☐ require less jquery
☐ try chunked bundles
☐ test bump

Now:
  ☐ require less polyfills (https://github.com/zloirock/core-js/issues/388)
  ☐ [demo] add init/destroy api to for Openers, Closers, and Togglers
  ☐ autofocus should probably be called when widgetizing
  ☐ lazy inside a modal doesn't work
  ☐ toast: option for moving the bottom queues up on scrolling (so that they don't go over the footer)
  ☐ editor: link and image should highlight the link, not the alt/name text
  ☐ add global error/success handlers, so that we can implement a `login to do that` functionality
  ☐ add an option for keeping checkbox/radio buttons active when active
  ☐ add an option for keeping togglers/openers active when their target is open
  ☐ tagbox: tag on empty partial input should do nothing
  ☐ export some modules to github/npm
  ☐ remote loader: if it fails, retry! (N times?)
  ☐ input autocomplete plugin (like typeahead.js)
  ☐ add pure css tooltips like materializecss' (we already have a `tooltip` component)
  ☐ add a storable form
  ☐ On mobile remove focus from liker after click (it should show the updated counter, not the text for removing the like...) (search for: "sticky hover")
  ☐ Test pointer with touchpad connected to a phone (working as a mouse), or on touchscreen laptop, or OTG a mouse to it
  ☐ add style on :focus, also add better keyboard navigation support

Next:
  ☐ center sortable names, or when also `text-align: center` they will look misaligned
  ☐ dinamically check for classes, like when using `isOpen` etc.
  ☐ reorganize widget_helper (like progressbar or noty), it currently conflicts with table_helper which is an entirely different thing
  ☐ find a pattern like ___ but for UNinitialize, use in combination with initializers... maybe when call it pass true or false... maybe just ___foo_off

Future:
  ☐ use emojione v3
  ☐ [widget] add better support for updating after options are set at runtime
  ☐ an utility for dinamically creating a dialog, like a modal for confirmation and stuff
  ☐ [SASS] add string related functions to _, take them from here: https://github.com/HugoGiraudel/SassyStrings/tree/master/stylesheets
  ☐ add this._onFocus ()
  ☐ selecter, like numbox but with custom values and chevrons, not editable (once it's done add it for editing the colors of the widgets)
  ☐ new checkable widget, like selectable but with checkboxes (should work like gmail's)
  ☐ maybe add also a special `scroll` option key, for triggering actions automagically
  ☐ add generalized affix/sticky support
  ☐ add i18n support
  ☐ add a `KineticDrag` component, or maybe a `kinetic` option to `draggable`

Maybe:
  ☐ add a .multiple.reverse
  ☐ sort sass files properties
  ☐ abort zoomable preloading on subsequent taps

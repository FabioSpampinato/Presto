Now:
  ☐ maybe .table tbody tr.table-row-empty td should have vertical-align: middle
  ☐ maybe non-center sections should have `no-grow` by default
  ✔ add support for a `close` parameter, useful on ajax request when a remoteModal should be closed on completion @done (11/14/2016, 5:30:36 PM)
  ☐ maybe enforce min-height on toolbar maybe, and use that value for layout-header sticky margin-top
  ☐ add a @before in toolbar for card, so that a card-header can have toolbar's padding instead
    ☐ are you sure it will work?
  ☐ style default select (too ugly on firefox)
  ☐ .multiple.only-separators don't seem to work properly
  ☐ repositionate popover on resize, for instance when using a datepicker or a select it may change width

Next:
  ☐ `a` elements should be `actionable` by default
  ☐ select inside a remote modal, the modal could get closed while the select will still be there
  ☐ add support for CommonJS or AMD export syntax
    ☐ datatables don't get loaded under Meteor for instance
  ☐ center sortable names, or when also `text-align: center` they will look misaligned
  ☐ rotate select's icon when open
    ☐ also keep the select button `.active`... SURE?
  Gulp:
    ☐ admin tasks only for admin with the `isAdmin` task specified into the project
    ☐ add a `gulp install` or `gulp init` task, very much like Semantic UI did
  To fix:
    ☐ dinamically check for classes, like when using `isOpen` etc.
    ☐ reorganize widget_helper (like progressbar or noty), it currently conflicts with table_helper which is an entirely different thing
    ☐ lower cyclomatic complexity
    ☐ find a pattern like ___ but for UNinitialize, use in combination with initializers (maybe when call it passe true or false)

Future:
  ☐ [widget] add better support for updating after options are set at runtime
  ☐ add style on :focus, also add better keyboard navigation support
  ☐ adding `@require`s to extenders (.before, .after) doesn't work, since they get moved after... maybe we should move left or right the one more to the left in the dependencies list instead...
  ☐ emoji
    ☐ https://github.com/Ranks/emojify.js
    ☐ https://github.com/twitter/twemoji
  ☐ an utility for dinamically creating a dialog, like a noty but with more buttons
  ☐ add autofocus capabilities to noty, modal and panel, basically everything that appears
  ☐ add pure css tooltips like materializecss'
  ☐ [SASS] add string related functions to _, take them from here: https://github.com/HugoGiraudel/SassyStrings/tree/master/stylesheets
  ☐ [demo] add init/destroy api to for Openers, Closers, and Togglers
  ☐ add this._onFocus ()
  ☐ widget for running actions over selectable's selected elements, like a floating noty or a slim panel
  ☐ selecter, like numbox but with custom values and chevrons, not editable (once it's done add it for editing the colors of the widgets)
  ☐ remote loader of stuff, not just remoteModal but more generic
  ☐ new checkable widget, like selectable but with checkboxes (should work like gmail's)
  ☐ maybe add also a special `scroll` option key, for triggering actions automagically
  ☐ input autocomplete plugin (like typeahead.js)
  ☐ fullscreen library
  ☐ chart library
  ☐ add i18n support

Maybe:
  ☐ add a .multiple.reverse
  ☐ sort sass files properties
  ☐ maybe rename lQuery to yocto or atto o some other prefix, like zepto
  ☐ create proper admin@getsvelto.com that we'll use for npm, atmosphere, github etc.

# Svelto

Modular front end framework for modern browsers, with battery included: 100+ widgets and tools.

## Usage

Svelto is **currently** undocumented, so obviously not a viable pick if you're looking for a framework for your next project.

BUT, if you are curious, you may run the demo, read the instructions in the following section.

## Demo

It is basically a Meteor app showcasing everything available, used for testing.

It requires you to have Meteor [installed](https://www.meteor.com/install) on your machine.

After having installed Meteor, execute the following commands:

```shell
git clone https://www.github.com/svelto/svelto.git
cd svelto
npm install
cd demo
npm install
gulp build
gulp demo
```

Then go to [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333) and explore.

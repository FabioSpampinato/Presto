# Svelto

Modular front end framework for modern browsers, with battery included: 100+ widgets and tools.

## Usage

Svelto is **currently** undocumented, so obviously not a viable pick if you're looking for a framework for your next project.

But, if you are curious, you can check out the [live demo](https://github.com/svelto/svelto-demo).
